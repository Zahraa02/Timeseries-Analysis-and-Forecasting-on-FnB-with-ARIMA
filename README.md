# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis & Demand Forecasting on FnB Data ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive time series analysis and forecasting model developed using R to predict future demand for a Food & Beverage (FnB) operation. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence, driving efficiency and reducing operational waste.

This report was generated using **R Markdown**, providing a clear, reproducible, and interactive analysis.

## Key Outcomes & Business Value

* **Accurate Forecasting:** Developed and validated a time series model (likely ARIMA or a similar robust method) to accurately forecast future FnB demand, providing a foundation for inventory optimization.
* **Pattern Identification:** Extracted critical insights into seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns within the sales data, explaining past performance.
* **Operational Efficiency:** The forecasts enable proactive inventory management, reducing perishable goods waste and ensuring better stock availability during peak demand periods.
